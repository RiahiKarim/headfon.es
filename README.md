javascript-architecture
=======================

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This repo serves as an organization of some thoughts I've been having over the past
few months regarding how I would like to structure certain types of client-side JavaScript applications.

The case study for this is using the Spotify API as a base service.

Here is a high level view of how this is structured across the client and server:

### client

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) base template for the setup. Currently it is non-ejected.
- [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router) routing
- [react-copy-write](https://github.com/aweary/react-copy-write) state management
- [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) type system
- [Spotify Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/)

### server

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) server platform
- [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) data transport
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) Spotify Web API
- [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) type system
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database local
- [mLab](https://mlab.com/) database cloud

### environment variables

Initially I had the environment variables stored in a `.env` file. After some more research, and wanting to have this setup to deploy to services such as [now](https://zeit.co/now) and reading [12factor](https://12factor.net/config), I moved them out and will load them into the environment manually on whichever platform. Below is a documentation of which environment variables this app uses.

```bash
DEBUG=false

PROD_HOST=http://localhost
DEV_HOST=http://localhost
PROD_PORT=3000
DEV_PORT=3004
SESSION_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT=/auth/callback
JWT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
MONGO_DB_URI_DEV="mongodb://localhost:27017/<database-name>"
MONGO_DB_URI_PROD="mongodb://<username>:<password>@<instance>.mlab.com:13402/<database-name>"
JWT_ISSUER=spotify-app-dev
JWT_AUDIENCE=spotify-app-user
```

# deployment

This can be deployed using a service such as [now](https://zeit.co/now):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjw56/spotify
cd spotify
now -e SESSION_SECRET="thisisasecret" -e SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXX -e SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXX -e SPOTIFY_REDIRECT=XXXXXXX -e JWT_SECRET="XXXXXXX" -e MONGO_DB_URI_PROD="XXXXXXX" -e JWT_ISSUER=XXXXXXX-e JWT_AUDIENCE=XXXXXXX
```

voila!

Happy Hacking!
